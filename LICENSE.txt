Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this 
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other 
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure 
everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or 
without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, 
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit 
for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications 
made by others.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free 
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program 
should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. 
But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for 
any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published 
as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose 
purpose is instruction or reference.
